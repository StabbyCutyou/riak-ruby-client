title: Key-Value
---
Key-value operations in Riak use a few different kinds of object:

* A **bucket type** is a set of configration information used to read and write
  values in Riak. Bucket types are complex and can be unintuitive, so
  [please read the bucket type documentation][1].
* A **bucket** is a named collection of keys. It's similar to a table in a SQL
  database: it has a name that's a string, zero or more members, and members
  can be quickly looked up by their key (primary key in SQL).
* A **key** is a unique string name for something in a bucket. Think of them
  like a SQL primary key that's a string.
* A **value** is a large binary object that is addressed by a bucket type,
  bucket, and key. It works similarly to a BLOB column in SQL. Riak objects
  can have more than one value, which requires conflict resolution.

For more about buckets, keys, and values, read the [object/key operations][2]
documentation.

## tl;dr

Get an object:

``` ruby
# get a bucket
bucket = client.bucket 'pages'

# â€¦or get a bucket-typed bucket
type = client.bucket_type 'my_cool_type'
bucket = type.bucket 'pages'

# get an object
object = bucket.get 'index.html'
object = bucket['index.html']

# get or create an object
object = bucket.get_or_new 'index.html'

# create a new object
object = bucket.new 'index.html'

# change the object's data and save
object.raw_data = "<html><body>Hello, world!</body></html>"
object.content_type = "text/html"
object.store

# reload an object you already have the vclock of
object.reload

# reload an object without the vclock
object.reload :force => true

# delete an object
object.delete
```

## Objects

Riak's key-value interface maniuplates objects. You can think of an object as
a tuple:

```ruby
  {bucket type, bucket, key, metadata, values}
```

A bucket type and bucket identify a collection of objects, and the set of
bucket type, bucket, and key identify a single object.

In the Ruby client, a Riak object is represented by a `Riak::RObject` instance.

```ruby
robject = bucket['S. S. Boatname']
robject.class #=> Riak::RObject
```

### Creating Objects

You have a few choices when insantiating an object.

Given a bucket, you can use the `RObject` constructor to create a new object:

```ruby
Riak::RObject.new bucket, 'Son of Boatname'
```

If you use the `Bucket#new` method, the `RObject` is created with a
`content_type` of `application/json` for you:

```ruby
bucket.new 'Son of Boatname'
```

If you want Riak to pick a key for an object for you, create one without
specifying a key:

```ruby
# these both work
robject = Riak::RObject.new bucket, nil
robject = bucket.new

robject.store
robject.key #=> "GB8fW6DDZtXogK19OLmaJf247DN"
```

### Loading Objects

You can load an object if you know its key. If loading the object fails, this
will raise a `Riak::FailedRequest` error with the `not_found?` flag set.

```ruby
bucket['S. S. Boatname']
bucket.get 'S. S. Boatname'
```

If you want to load or create an object with a given key, you can use
`Bucket#get_or_new` to do it:

```ruby
bucket.get_or_new 'Revenge of Boatname'
```

#### Loading Many Objects

Sometimes, you need to load a lot of objects in preparation for aggregation or
another operation. The multi-get functionality allows you to use a nested
`Array` of `[Bucket, String<key>]` identifiers ("pairs") to load objects using
multiple worker threads.

The array of pairs should be structured like this:

```ruby
pairs = [
    [bucket, 'S. S. Boatname'],
    [bucket, 'Son of Boatname'],
    [bucket, 'Revenge of Boatname'],
]
```

The `Riak::Client#get_many` and `Riak::Multiget.get_all` class
methods simply return the hash of pair to `RObject` instances:

```ruby
# equivalent
results = client.get_many pairs
results = Riak::Multiget.get_all client, pairs
```

If you want to kick off a multiget operation and perform some other operations
while it proceeds, use an instance of the `Riak::Multiget` class.

```ruby
mg = Riak::Multiget.new client, pairs
mg.fetch
puts "Loading... Please wait..."
results = mg.results
```

### Manipulating and Storing Objects

#### Raw Data, No Serialization

Use the `RObject#raw_data` accessors to manipulate the raw blob/string that
represents the value of a Riak object. The client will not transform or parse
this data.

```ruby
robject.content_type = 'image/jpeg'
robject.raw_data = File.read 'cat.jpg'
robject.store
```

#### Serializing and Deserializing Data

Frequently, you'll store objects you want to be serialized and deserialized
for you. Set an appropriate content-type and use the `#data` accessors:

```ruby
robject.content_type = 'application/json'
robject.data = {
    processor: 'MSP-430',
    sensors: %w{range binocular video},
    motor: "trolling motor",
    length: 137.16
}
robject.store # serializes the Ruby hash to JSON
robject.raw_data #=> "{\"processor\": \"MSP-430\"...
robject.data #=> {"processor" => "MSP-430",...
```

Out of the box, the Ruby client supports serializing and deserializing these
content-types:

* `text/plain`: string data only
* `application/json`: uses `MultiJson`
* `application/x-ruby-marshal`: uses `Marshal` in the Ruby core
* `text/yaml`, `text/x-yaml`, `application/yaml`, `application/x-yaml`: use
  `YAML` in the Ruby standard library.

##### Other Content Types

Support for other content-types can be added: write a module with `dump(object)`
and `load(string)` methods, and configure it with the `Riak::Serializers[]`
method. For an example, note how the `TextPlain` and `ApplicationJSON`
serializers are written and configured in the [`Riak::Serializer` module.][4]

### Deleting Objects

Objects can be deleted two different ways: the `delete` method on `RObject`
instances, or the `delete` method on `Bucket` instances.

Deleting a `RObject` you have already fetched is easy. After the `delete` method
returns, the instance will still have its data, but be frozen to prevent
further changes.

```ruby
robject.delete
```

Deleting from the `Bucket` without providing a `vclock` or causal context can
cause issues if the object is updated and deleted at about the same time:

```ruby
# delete the object with key 'Son of Boatname' without any causal context
bucket.delete 'Son of Boatname'

# delete the object with key 'Son of Boatname' with causal context
bucket.delete 'Son of Boatname', vclock: 'a85hYGBgzGDKBVIcypz/fpZz1XzPYEpkzGNluD1P4xxfFgA='
```

## Content and Conflict

Riak objects can have more than one value. If you have an eventually-consistent
bucket (i.e. not strongly consistent) with `allow_mult` enabled and
`last_write_wins` disabled ([choose wisely][6], [it's important][7]), multiple
values for a given object are common.

[6]: http://aphyr.com/posts/285-call-me-maybe-riak
[7]: http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/using/conflict-resolution/

Resolving conflicts can be tricky! [Riak's CRDT implementation][8] and how the
[Ruby client CRDT support][9] works may lead you to a better solution than
relying on client-side conflict resolution.

[8]: http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/using/data-types/
[9]: /crdt.html

The `Riak::RContent` class handles properties of an individual value. Without
conflict, [`Riak::RObject` delegates many of its apparent properties][10] to an
`RContent` instance. With conflict, attempts to access these properties will
raise a `Riak::Conflict` error.

[10]: https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client/blob/62551f1873f50d40a004b9a27a282bb7e88be329/lib/riak/robject.rb#L56-L64

```ruby
robject.conflict? #=> true
robject.raw_data # raises Riak::Conflict
```

### Manual Conflict Resolution

If a `Riak::RObject` is in conflict, you can resolve the conflict by setting its
`siblings` array to an array with one element. Ideally, you'll loop through the
array of siblings and accumulate a correct one.

In this case, assume we have objects that store a single number, and we want to
resolve them to the maximum.

```ruby
robject.conflict? #=> true

max_sibling = robject.siblings.inject do |max_sibling, current_sibling|
    next max_sibling if max_sibling.data > current_sibling.data
    next current_sibling
end

robject.siblings = [max_sibling.dup]
robject.store

robject.reload
robject.conflict? #=> false
```

### Conflict Resolution Callbacks

`Riak::RObject` also has `on_conflict` hooks. These hooks work much like manual
conflict resolution. Register them with [`Riak::RObject.on_conflict`][11], and
trigger then on a conflicted object with `RObject#attempt_conflict_resolution`.

[11]: http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/riak-client/Riak/RObject.on_conflict

With the same scenario as above:

```ruby
Riak::RObject.on_conflict do |robject|
    max_sibling = robject.siblings.inject do |max_sibling, current_sibling|
        next max_sibling if max_sibling.data > current_sibling.data
        next current_sibling
    end

    robject.siblings = [max_sibling.dup]
end

object.conflict? #=> true
object.attempt_conflict_resolution
object.store
object.conflict? #=> false
```

You can have multiple conflict resolution callbacks. If they return `nil` the
next one in the list will fire. If you want different callbacks for different
buckets, simply make the first thing they do check if the bucket is the expected
one:

```ruby
Riak::RObject.on_conflict do |robject|
  next nil unless robject.bucket.name == 'robots'
  # actually resolve the robot conflict
end
```

If none of the handlers resolve the conflict, the object will remain in
conflict.

## Working with Bucket Types

Bucket types are used to configure and scope bucket behavior. If you are working
with objects scoped to bucket types, there are two APIs for handling them.

### 2.2 Bucket-Typed Bucket API

The 2.2 version of the client introduces a bucket types, buckets, and key-value
objects that know what bucket type they have.

`BucketType` instances create `BucketTyped::Bucket` instances:

```ruby
# Instantiate a Riak::BucketType from the client
my_cool_type = client.bucket_type 'my_cool_type'

# Create a Riak::BucketTyped::Bucket
cool_pages = my_cool_type.bucket 'pages'

# BucketTyped::Bucket is a Bucket subclass
cool_pages.is_a? Riak::Bucket #=> true
cool_pages.is_a? Riak::BucketTyped::Bucket #=> true
```

Bucket-typed buckets are a subclass of untyped buckets (which are handled as
default-typed buckets in Riak). Just like regular buckets, they can create
key-value objects:

```ruby
my_homepage = cool_pages.get_or_new 'index.html'
under_construction = cool_pages.new 'under_construction.gif'
background_music = cool_pages.get 'STAIRW~1.MID'
```

### Options-hash-based Bucket Type API

**This API is difficult to work with and requires care with passing in options.
We do not recommend using it for new development.**

2.0 and 2.1 versions of the client do not have special support for bucket
types. Key-value operations that require a bucket type must have the type
passed in with the options hash.

```ruby
my_homepage = cool_pages.get 'index.html', type: 'my_cool_type'
my_homepage.data = my_homepage.data +
  "&lt;marquee&gt;welcome to the last line of my homepage&lt;/marquee&gt;"
my_homepage.store type: 'my_cool_type'
my_homepage.reload type: 'my_cool_type'
```

If the type is omitted from these methods, the operation will interact with the
object in the default type instead of `my_cool_type`. This is why we recommend
the easier Bucket-Typed Bucket API.
